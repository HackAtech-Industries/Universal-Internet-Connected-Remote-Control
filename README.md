# Universal-Internet-Connected-Remote-Control
Recent articles explored several ways for makers to utilize infrared LEDs in their projects using an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, a short series discussed the fundamental concepts behind IR communications that can also be useful in many other electronics projects that require sending or receiving infrared signals. This article discusses an IoT project that allows its users to send IR signals from any computer within a network. For that purpose, an ESP8266-enabled development board is connected to an IR sender module, and the finished device hosts a website that allows users to send out codes. The device can be useful, for example, to remote-control several devices from within a network without having to replace the existing electronic equipment with  connected items.
